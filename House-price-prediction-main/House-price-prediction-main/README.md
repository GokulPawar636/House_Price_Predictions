-House Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for building a machine-learning model to predict residential house sale prices. It uses Python 3.x, scikit-learn, optionally TensorFlow, along with pandas, NumPy, matplotlib and Jupyter Notebooks.
The dataset used is the “House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques” dataset from Kaggle, covering homes in Ames, Iowa, with features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, year built, etc.
